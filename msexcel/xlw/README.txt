
XLW MS Excel Wrapper Generator (5.0.0)
======================================

This directory contains a local copy of the XLW code taken from
svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/xlw/code/tags/R050000f0 (at rev1453)

We've created this local copy of XLW because of the very large size of their
binary download, together with the difficulties of supporting different GCC
compilers, with different exception convections (sjlj, etc). It's really
just easier to compile our own copy.

The compilation of this code is handled by the top-level freesteam SCons
build script, the code does not need to be built separately.
