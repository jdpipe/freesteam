EMSO TEST FILES
----------------------------

Open these files in EMSO after you've followed the installation instructions 
in the parent directory.

These files are intended to demonstrate a simple power station cycle calculation.

There is an mso.syn file included which facilitates editing MSO file from within
the Windows-based editor 'TextPad'.
