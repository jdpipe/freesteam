#*
    Basic model for a water/steam stream.

    This model only defines the variables of a stream.
    It can be extended for use with any models where at least the following variables are required.
*#
Model Stream_Base as Steam_Base # DF = 6 + 1 = 7
    
    VARIABLES
    mdot as MassFlowRate;

end

Model Stream_ps as Steam_ps # DF = 2 + 1 = 3
    
    VARIABLES
    mdot as MassFlowRate;
    
end

Model Stream_ph as Steam_ph # DF = 2 + 1 = 3
    
    VARIABLES
    mdot as MassFlowRate;
    
end

Model Stream_waterT as Steam_waterT # DF = 1 + 1 = 3
    
    VARIABLES
    mdot as MassFlowRate;
    
end
