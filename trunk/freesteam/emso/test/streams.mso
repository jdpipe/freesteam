#*
	Basic model for a water/steam stream.

	This model only defines the variables of a stream.
	It can be extended for use with any models where at least the following variables are required.
*#
Model Stream_Base as Steam_Base
	
	VARIABLES
	mdot as MassFlowRate;

end


#** 
	General steam stream model

	If you specify parameters in terms other than p,s then solver will work out what p,s are by solving
*#
Model Stream_ps as Stream_Base
	
	PARAMETERS
	ext freesteam as CalcObject(Brief="Steam Physical Properties");
	
	EQUATIONS
	"Steam properties"
	[T, s, v, x] = freesteam.Tsvx_ph(p, h);
