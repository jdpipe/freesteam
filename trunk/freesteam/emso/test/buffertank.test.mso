#*
	Simple test of a buffer tank. Water flows in at
	a steady rate, and mixes with the water in the tank.
	
	The temperature of the water coming out at the
	outlet should gradually rise to equal the
	temperature of the water being pumped into the tank.

	THIS FLOWSHEET WORKS IN STEADY STATE
	BUT COMPLAINS ABOUT derivatives="symbolic" WHEN ATTEMPTING
	TO RUN TRANSIENT CASE.
