Introduction</a></h2>
This is the C++ class documentation for freesteam, generated using the doxygen tool. Please visit <a href="http://freesteam.sf.net/">http://freesteam.sf.net/</a> for the latest information on freesteam.<p>
Freesteam implements the international-standard steam tables from the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam, IAPWS. The correlations for both IAPWS-IF97 and IAPWS-95 are provided, although the emphasis is on the use of the IAPWS-IF97 correlation.<p>
To get to the meaty bits, see the <a class="el" href="class_steam_calculator.html">SteamCalculator</a>, <a class="el" href="class_solver2.html">Solver2</a> and <a class="el" href="class_solver.html">Solver</a> classes, and after that have a look at <a class="el" href="class_sat_curve.html">SatCurve</a>, <a class="el" href="class_b23_curve.html">B23Curve</a>, <a class="el" href="class_b13_curve.html">B13Curve</a> and Boundaries.<h2><a class="anchor" name="sourcecode">
Source Code Layout</a></h2>
Here are a few conventions used in the source code<ul>
<li>CppUnit test cases are always given filenames ending in .test.cpp</li><li>Compile time testing cases are given filenames ending in .cpass.cpp and .cfail.cpp (depending on whether they are or are not supposed to compile successfully)</li><li>Command line utilities are given filenames ending in .cli.cpp</li><li>Certain other targets exist in the Makefile, such as diagram.m, etc: these are usually greated as the output from the corresponding .cli.exe program.</li></ul>
<p>
Where possible, C++ references have been used, and methods have been suitably 'constified', but there may still be gaps in that.<h2><a class="anchor" name="license">
